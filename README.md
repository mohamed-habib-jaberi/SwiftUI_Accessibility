# SwiftUI_Accessibility
SwiftUI is a declarative Component-Oriented framework. You have to forget about MVC where you have controllers mediating between view and model. SwiftUI uses diffing algorithm to understand changes and update only corresponding views.

@State
A State property is connected to the view. A State property is permanently being read by the view. That means that every time the @State property gets changed/updated, the view gets re-rendered and eventually displays the content depending on the @State's data.
State is accessible only to a particular view.
Simple properties like strings, integers and booleans belongs to a single view - mark as private.
All the fields marked as State are stored in special separated memory, where only corresponded view can access and update them.

Do I need to modify a value that is private to me? => State

@State
- It is used to update the value of a variable every time.
- We can also say it's a two way binding.
- If we change the property state then SwiftUI will automatically reload the body of the view.
- It is used for simple properties like strings, integers and booleans.

@Binding
BindableObject protocol, which requires a didChange property. It makes possible to use it inside Environment and rebuild view as soon as it changes.
The didChange property should be a Publisher, which is a part of a new Appleâ€™s Reactive framework called Combine.
The main goal of Publisher is to notify all subscribers when something changes. As soon as new values appear, SwiftUI will rebuild Views.

Do I need to modify a State of some other view? => Binding

@Binding
- Using this, you can access the state property of another view.
- It will give you the read and write access for the variable.

@EnvironmentObject
It is a part of feature called Environment. You can populate your Environment with all needed service classes and then access them from any view inside that Environment.
@EnvironmentObject is accessible for every view inside the Environment.
@EnvironmentObject Properties created elsewhere such as shared data. App crashes if it is missing.
The Environment is the right way of Dependency Injection with SwiftUI.
